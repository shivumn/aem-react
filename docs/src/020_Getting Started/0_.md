In this guide we will use the maven archetype to generate a project structure.
It already includes some demo content and react components.

_Requirements_

 * Adobe Experience Manager 6 or higher
 * Apache Maven (3.x should do)


The example react components are written in Typescript. The node build tools
are also assuming that you are developing in Typescript. If you want to use another dialect you need to
tewak the build scripts.
