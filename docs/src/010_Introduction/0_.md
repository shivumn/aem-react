The goal of the AEM ([Adobe Experience Manager](http://www.adobe.com/de/marketing-cloud/enterprise-content-management.html)) React library is to use [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) as a templating engine
for AEM components. React is a popular javascript ui library by facebook.

# Why React and AEM?

React components are ideal to create web applications with complex client-side interactivity. AEM provides a perfect authoring interface for web content.
This project brings these technologies together, so that you can build highly interactive web pages with a professional authoring tool.

# Features

- [Universal](http://www.2ality.com/2015/08/isomorphic-javascript.html) React rendering
- High performance javascript execution with a pool of Java 8 [nashorn](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/scripting/nashorn/) engines.
- Nesting React components in other AEM components and vice versa is supported.
- Converting vanilla (plain) react components into AEM components is supported.
- SPA based on react router is supported.

# Projects

## AEM project

The [aem-react project](https://github.com/sinnerschrader/aem-react) consists of the following parts:

- osgi bundle contains the Sling Script Engine to render AEM components written in react.
- maven archetype is a fork of the AEM archetype and adds react support and examples.
- demo content package provides examples for components and SPA.

Maven artifact is available via [maven central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Caem-react)

## Javascript project

The aem-react projects relies on the [aem-react-js subproject](https://github.com/sinnerschrader/aem-react-js), which provides
the basic javascript funtionality. It is
available as [npm
 module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aem-react-js).


## Maven archetype project

Lastly a [maven-archetype](https://github.com/sinnerschrader/aem-project-archetype) is avilable to quickly create an AEM maven project including react components.
It is a fork of the existing offical [AEM maven archetype](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/aem-project-archetype).
