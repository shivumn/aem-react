A vanilla react component can be registered
as a AEM component as well.

````typescript
registry.registerVanilla({component: TextField});
registry.registerVanilla({component: Panel, parsys: {path: "content"}, depth: 2});
````

All resource properties are passed as props to the component.

For a simple component that only needs a single level of the resource tree
 and doesn't display children it is sufficient to define the React component class
 that should be registered. The following additional parameters are available

 parameter | type | description
 ---|---|---
 depth | number | the number of levels of the resource available
 props? | any | extra props that are passed
 parsys? | object | define this property to define a parsys as the only child of this component
 parsys.path | string | the relative content path to store children 
 parsys.className?| string | class name added to the parsys element
 parsys.elementName?| string | name of the parsys element (default is "div")
 parsys.childElementName?| string| If provided each child is wrapped in an extra element
 parsys.childClassName?| string| class name added to children elements.
 transform? | function | a function to tranform the resource into react props
 
 # Container
 
 If the `parsys` property is set then the vanilla component will be turned into
 an AEM container. The `.content.xml` must also set the corresponding attribute:
 
 ````xml
 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
 <jcr:root xmlns:sling="http://sling.apache.org/jcr/sling/1.0" xmlns:cq="http://www.day.com/jcr/cq/1.0" xmlns:jcr="http://www.jcp.org/jcr/1.0"
     jcr:primaryType="cq:Component"
     jcr:title="My Title"
     cq:isContainer="true"
     />
 ````
 
# Resource transformation

If the resource's structure does not match the props of the vanilla component then a transformation can be used.
A transformation is a function that is passed the resource and the resourceComponent and returns the props that will be passed to
the react component.

In this example a sling model is used in the transformation:
````typescript
let transform: any = (resource: any, wrapper: ResourceComponent<any, any, any>) => {
    let model: ServiceProxy = r.getResourceModel("demop.core.models.MyModel");
    let newProps: any = {title: resource.label};
    newProps["imageSrc"] = model.invoke("getImageSrc");
    return newProps;
};

registry.registerVanilla({
    component: myComponent, transform: transform
});
