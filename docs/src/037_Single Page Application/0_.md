This section explains how to create a single page application (SPA) using the [react-router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router)
library. The goal of a single page application is to provide content to the user spread 
across different views that can be navigated like any website but does not require a slow browser reload.
Each view in this SPA should be bookmarkable if appropriate. The initial view should be rendered
 on the server for performance reasons and also to make the page crawlable by search bots and the likes.
